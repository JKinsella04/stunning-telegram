## 4/13/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9744; Dylan, &#9745; Ian, &#9745; Jack

#### Goals For Today
- Add tracking wheels onto drive base
- Begin practicing LRT driving strategies
- Create an auto-indexing function for driving
- Add a goal pusher
- Add standoffs to allow us to score balls on the outside of the goals for LRT.

Our first LRT tourmamnet is next week on 4/22 and so we are finishing up our robot and beginning to start developing our strategies for the tournament. Since the rules for a ball being considered *scored* is different we can now score balls that are stuck between our robot and that breach the ring of the goal. This new rule allows us to score many more balls in the middle goal which will be imperative to some strategies we will do in the tournament. To score more balls efficiently we added standoffs on the tower that are parallel with the intakes. These will help hold the balls in a position that they are scored in. 

#### Goals Accomplished
- Auto-indexing function
- goal pusher
- tracking wheels
- standoffs for special scoring in LRT

#### LRT Autonomous
- Does Goals E, A, D / Middle goal + left corner and middle home row goals.
- Before our second LRT we plan to make score the entire home row instead of just two of the goals.

#### Driver Practice
- We practiced by running through a couple test runs in which Derek attempted to prioritize scoring in the diagonal A-E-I. 

#### Goals Accomplished
- Robot Size Check
- LRT autonomous
- Driver Practice

#### Goals For Today:
- Driver Practice!

#### Driver Practice
Derek spent today just working on his fundamentals instead of driving a specific strategy. We decided to practice fundamentals instead of a strategy becaue it is important for Derek to be comfortable with the robot since he has not had a lot of practice with the new robot. Derek focused on reinforcing his cycling balls out of goals and also scoring, which we believe are the two core parts of LRT matches. 
> Cycling balls is just as important as scoring in goals because there are only 10 balls that are not scored in goals at the start of a match. Since the majority of the balls are scattered between the 8 outside goals, it is important to be able to quickly cycle balls out of the goals so you only grab the specific balls you want. To aid in Derek's cycling we created a auto indexing function where the robot will stop one ball at the top of the rollers and one ball at the bottom. This is helpful since it allows Derek to hold one button and grab two balls and then more easily only leaving the goal with the wanted ball(s).

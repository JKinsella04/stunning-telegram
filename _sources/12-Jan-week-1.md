# 1/4/22-1/6/22
## 1/4/22 
### Attendance: &#9744; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Test robot on the field.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Test robot on the field.

#### How:
- Since today was our first practice back at the school, we spent today testing the robot on the field and tuning the code to make the robot function properly.
- Jack changed the front lift code to properly move the lift and support itself while holding a goal. Just like before the robot now can lift up goals and hold them without any problem. Jack also automated the back lift by combining the two pneumatic pistons that fire. Now when Derek presses the UP button, it will clamp onto the goal and then tilt the goal into position. 
- To help with tuning the ring hood, Derek is going to switch to making a static conveyer belt hood instead of one that unfolds. 

#### Why:
- Jack automated the back lift so it is easy for Derek to grab goals while driving. The current automation of the robot allows for Derek to have easy and efficient control over the robot.
- Current Button mapping
    - L1 - front Lift Up
    - L2 - Font Lift Down
    - R1 - Toggle Clamp
    - R2 - Release Clamp
    - UP - Back Lift Clamp + Tilt + Spin Conveyer
    - RIGHT - Back Lift Release + Untilt + Stop Conveyer

### Plans for next Practice:
- Build static ring hood.

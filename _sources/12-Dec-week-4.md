### Attendance: &#9744; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9744; Jack
### Goals:
- Design new license plates.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Design new license plates.

#### How:
- With the new robot our old license plates no longer fit on our robot and so Derek designed new license plates to better fight the new robot.

#### Why:
- Derek redesigned the new license plate to cleanly cover the side of the drive base while also making it very easy for the referees to know what side we are on. 

### Plans for next Practice:
- Build and test ring hood.

## 12/29/21
### Attendance: &#9744; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9744; Jack
### Goals:
- Build and test ring hood.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Build and test ring hood.

#### How:
- Today Derek began building and testing the hood to guide the rings onto the alliance goal post. To goal of the hood is to ensure that every ring we pick up falls onto the post correctly. Most teams use polycarbonate hoods but Derek chose to use metal for the simplicity and to be able to easily change the design.

```

#### Why:
- Derek chose to go with a metal hood because the rings bounce off metal more consistently than off plastic. With our conveyer belt we also have limited attachment points and becaues of that the plastic would be out of size.
- Currently this design has a chance of rings launching out the front of it. To solve this Derek is going to add a plastic ring guard that will block the front and the top of the hood.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Perfect the ring hood.
- Finalize the robot.

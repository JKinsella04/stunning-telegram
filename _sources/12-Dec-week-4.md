### Attendance: &#9744; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9744; Jack
### Goals:
- Design new license plates.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Design new license plates.

#### How:
- With the new robot our old license plates no longer fit on our robot and so Derek designed new license plates to better fight the new robot.

#### Why:
- Derek redesigned the new license plate to cleanly cover the side of the drive base while also making it very easy for the referees to know what side we are on. 

### Plans for next Practice:
- Finish the robot.

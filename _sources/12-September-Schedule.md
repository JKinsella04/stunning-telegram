Our schedule for this September.
```
Since we are beginning today and have just under two months before our first competition, we are planning on spending all of September building the robot and then using October to practice. Since our robot will be the Lift design it will only have two main subsystems. The drive base and the lifts. We will use our first week to build the drive base then the next two weeks to build the lifts, then the final two weeks will be for fine-tuning the entire robot to make sure everything performs to our standards.

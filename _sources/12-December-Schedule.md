Our schedule for this December.
```

After our second tournament we are now going to begin building our second robot design. This new robot will be able to manipulate two mobile goals and score rings on the alliance goals. With only a month before our next competition we will be under a short time span to complete this and have Derek and Jack practice driving and tuning the auton programs.

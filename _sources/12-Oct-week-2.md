### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Begin Testing the Elim match auton.
### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Begin Testing the Elim match auton.
- &#9745; Improve the Elim match auton.
#### How:
- Jack tested the Elim match auton and it works very well. The robot consistently scores both neutral alliance goals in 6 seconds. Since the auton moves so quickly, we are expanding it to also score the third goal as well.
- This part of the autonomous is not tuned perfectly yet and will require tomorrow to complete but we believe it will be worth the extra time since it will score us 20 more points and put Derek in a good starting position for the driver phase.

#### Why:
- We decided to expand on the original autonomous because of the extra time and because having a better autonomous will allow us to not worry about our teammate's autonomous during the elimination rounds.
- Below is the Elim match auton routine code.

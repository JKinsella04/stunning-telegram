## 11/2/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9744; Jack
### Goals:
- Continue Driver Practice
- Begin designing new robot
### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Continue Driver Practice
- &#9745; Cad of new drive base.
#### How:
- Since Jack was unable to attend practice today, instead of practicing the auton skills routine, Derek practiced driving.
- Derek also began working on the new robot's drive base. It will be a 6 motor 360rpm drive base on 4" wheels. This new drive base will move at 6.28 ft/sec. To get 360rpm we are using 600 rpm motors and gearing them down 3:5 to make their output 360rpm.

Our new drive base.
```

#### Why:
- With this new drive base we will be increasing from 4.73 ft/sec to 6.28 ft/sec. We are doing this because being faster than everyone else will grant us a very powerful advantage during the match and especially during the autonomous phases.
- We are making our drive base a 6 motor drive because we will need more power to support the increased speed. 

### Plans for next Practice:
- Restart the auton skills routine.

## 11/3/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Restart the auton skills routine.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Restart the auton skills routine.

#### How:
- Jack restarted the auton routine by desigining a new path. The path starts in the same spot and scorest the first goals in a similar manner but, it grabs the alliance goal with the back of the robot instead of the front clamp like it did before.
- Jack is also making more movements straight lines instead of moving the robot in arcs everytime. This should help with making the auton more consistent since the movements are less complicated.
#### Why:
- Jack swapped how the first two goals get grabbed because the first neutral goal we grab can often ruin a run if it does not get collected properly. Now the neutral goal is grabbed much more consistently.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Continue reworking the auton skills routine.
- Redesign the ring blockers.

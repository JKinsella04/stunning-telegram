# 3/15/22 - 3/17/22
## 3/15/22 
### Attendance: &#9744;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Build locking clamp prototype.
- Retune middle goal auton and Full AWP.
- Continue driver practice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Build locking clamp prototype.
- &#9745; Retune middle goal auton.
- &#9745; Continue driver practice.

#### How:
- Today Jack tuned the middle goal auton to use the okapi units. He also expanded it to score rings on the goal to accomplish half of the AWP bonus in case we run the autonomous in a qualifier match. He began tuning the full AWP auton but was unable to finish it today.

- Derek built a prototype of a locking clamp for the Worlds robot. This clamp is more advanced than our current clamp since it uses a halfcut that will lock the clamp making it impossible for another robot to steal a goal from the clamp.

- Derek continued practicing driving and is becoming more consistent at finishing the route before 60 seconds.

#### Why:
- Jack added the AWP bonus to the middle goal auton since there was about 11 seconds left and it will allow us to use this auton during qualifiers and still score the AWP bonus.

- We are going to use a locking clamp for worlds because it will be vital that we ensure no one can steal goals from us since all the robots at worlds will be very competitive. This design uses a 4 bar to lock the bottom bars in place and the only way for it to unlock is if the pneumatic releases and pulls the top bars down.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Finish tuning Full AWP auton and begin tuning skills auton.
- Continue building prototypes for worlds robot.
- Continue driver practice.

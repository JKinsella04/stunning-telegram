## 1/11/22 
### Attendance: &#9744; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Lengthen the ring hood.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Reroute AWP routine.

#### How:
- Jack rerouted the AWP routine and now it consistently scores rings in both goals and moves the alliance goal across the line to get us the Auton Win Point bonus. Tomorrow Jack will work on grabbing two yellow goals after scoring the Auton Win Point bonus. After scoring the preload rings, scoring 5 more rings and grabbing two yellow goals this auton will score a total of 64 points. Which is an increase from our old AWP routine which scored 23 points.

#### Why:
- Jack changed the AWP routine pathing because we deemed it more important to ensure that we score the Auton Win Point bonus before going for yellow goals since the extra win point is more important than securing one or two yellow goals in qualifier matches. 
- Since qualifier matches are 4 random teams it is safe to say that worst case scenario we will be able to fight for the yellow goals if our auton does not get them.
- We put extending the ring hood on hold for tomorrow because Jack wanted to restart the AWP routine since we were scraping the progress we made last week. 

### Plans for next Practice:
- Finish AWP routine.
- Lengthen the ring hood.

Our schedule for this January.
```

With the recent cancellation of the January 8th tournament we now have an extra week to perfect our robot while still having two whole weeks to practice before the tournament on the 22nd. Jack will begin working on the new match autons which will score more rings and goals then the previous ones. As well Jack will begin working on a new skills auton that utilizes the new pure pursuit movement.

# 2/1/22-2/3/22
```{Note}
Due to COVID our school went virtual last week causing us to skip practice on 1/18/22-1/20/22.
And the tournament on 1/22/22 was also rescheduled due to COVID for 2/12/22. So now our next tournament is 2/5/22.
```

## 2/1/22 
### Attendance: &#9745;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Start Skills routine
- Continue driver pratice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Start skills routine.
- &#9745; Adjust front clamp Angle.
- &#9745; Continue driver pratice.

#### How:
- Today Derek adjusted the front clamp's angle to make the clamp open more. This now allows the robot to more easily clamp onto goals since the clamp more easily clears the top of the mobile goal base. The angle the clamps holds the goal is still the same and rests flat on the base.

- Jack began mapping out the skills routine. Since we only have 3 practices before the next tournament the skills autonomous will not score very high but will score points which will be better than our last tournament in which the auton did not score any points. Jack's goal is to score 80 points by placing two goals onto the platform.

- Derek successfully finished a 310 driver skills run today at the 60 second mark. Now that he has achieved the driver run he will continue to practice to be able to more consistently get this score as well as get a better skills stop time.

#### Why:
- We spent time today to adjust the front clamp angle because it makes driving the robot easier for Derek. By making the front clamp more lenient it allows for Derek to grab goals quicker than before. This will also help in case any goals are stuck on rings or in a unexpected position during normal matches.

- Jack has decided to set the auton skills routine to a fairly simple goal since our original goal was too steep for our robot before. We will work on a simple expandable routine this week so then next week we can score even more goals for the tournament after this one.


### Plans for next Practice:
- &#9745; Start skills routine.
- &#9745; Continue driver pratice.

## 2/1/22 
### Attendance: &#9745;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Start Skills routine
- Continue driver pratice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Start skills routine.
- &#9745; Adjust front clamp Angle.
- &#9745; Continue driver pratice.

#### How:
- Today Derek adjusted the front clamp's angle to make the clamp open more. This now allows the robot to more easily clamp onto goals since the clamp more easily clears the top of the mobile goal base. The angle the clamps holds the goal is still the same and rests flat on the base.

- Jack began mapping out the skills routine. Since we only have 3 practices before the next tournament the skills autonomous will not score very high but will score points which will be better than our last tournament in which the auton did not score any points. Jack's goal is to score 80 points by placing two goals onto the platform.

- Derek successfully finished a 310 driver skills run today at the 60 second mark. Now that he has achieved the driver run he will continue to practice to be able to more consistently get this score as well as get a better skills stop time.

#### Why:
- We spent time today to adjust the front clamp angle because it makes driving the robot easier for Derek. By making the front clamp more lenient it allows for Derek to grab goals quicker than before. This will also help in case any goals are stuck on rings or in a unexpected position during normal matches.

- Jack has decided to set the auton skills routine to a fairly simple goal since our original goal was too steep for our robot before. We will work on a simple expandable routine this week so then next week we can score even more goals for the tournament after this one.


### Plans for next Practice:
- Start skills routine.
- Continue driver pratice.

## 2/2/22 
### Attendance: &#9745;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Start skills routine.
- Continue driver pratice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; 80 point skills routine.
- &#9745; Continue driver pratice.
#### How:
- Today Jack made a 80 point skills run that grabs two goals and elevates them onto the platform. Since today is the last practice before we have to move our field to the gym for the tournament we decided to just make an 80 point and spend the rest of the day practicing driving.
- Derek continued practicing driving the 310 driver route. He best run today was a 5 second stop time. 
#### Why:
- Jack made a 80 point skills auton because it is a simple auton to make that can also be expanded on next week before our next tournament. Before the tournament on 2/12 the skills auton will be increased to score at least 120 points.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Prepare and setup the tournament.

### Goals:
- Prepare and setup the tournament.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Prepare and setup the tournament.

#### How:
- Today all PSA teams in robotics worked on getting the tournament fields ready for this weekend.

#### Why:
- Since we had to deconstruct the field to move it to the gym of our school we were unable to practice auton or driver runs.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Make any changes based off tournament results.

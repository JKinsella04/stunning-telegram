Our schedule for this October.
```
With the robot finished, we are now entering the month of practice. With twelve practices before our first competition we have a total 30 practice hours. In past seasons this has not been enough time, so we are going to extend our practices by starting at 2:00 instead of 3:30, giving us a total of 48 practice hours. This will give us enough time to be able to have good autonomous routines while not stealing Derek's driver practice. 

| October Schedule | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Monthly Total |
|------------------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Programming      | 3 hours | 3 hours   | 0 hours  | 24 hours      |
| Driver           | 1 hour  | 1 hour    | 4 hours  | 24 hours      |

With the practices split up like this Jack will have 24 hours to work on the 3 autonomous routines and give Derek 24 hours to practice driving.

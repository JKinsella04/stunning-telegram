Our schedule for this October.
```
With the robot finished, we are now entering the month of practice. With twelve practices before our first competition we have a total 30 practice hours. In past seasons this has not been enough time, so we are going to extend our practices by starting at 2:00 instead of 3:30, giving us a total of 48 practice hours. This will give us enough time to be able to have good autonomous routines while not stealing Derek's driver practice. Tuesdays and Wednesdays will be autonomous centric days with 3 hours for Jack and 1 hour for Derek. Thursdays will be 4 hours just for Derek to practice driving. With the practices split up like this Jack will have 24 hours to work on the 3 autonomous routines and give Derek 24 hours to practice driving.

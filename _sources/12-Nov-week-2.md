## 11/9/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Continue Driver Practice.
- Continue Skills Auton.
### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Continue Driver Practice.
- &#9745; Continue Skills Auton.
- &#9745; Improve Ring Blockers
#### How:
- Today Jack continued working the skills auton. The third goal we are scoring is the tallest neutral goal. To score this goal though, Jack had to change the scoring of the first two goals. After scoring the third goal the robot will pick up the blue alliance goal that on the AWP line. 
- Derek began practicing the 313 auton route. The route is the same as before except for that we now park with the two blue alliance goals as opposed to just elevating them.
#### Why:
- Jack had to change the first two goals scoring because for the platform to balance the tall middle goal we have to offset the first two goals to one side and then score the tall middle goal on the other. 
- To help with parking Derek cut down the size of the ring blockers to make sure that they do not dig into the ground like before. With the new small ring blockers, we have enough clearance to properly park on the platform with two goals.
### Plans for next Practice:
- Continue Skills Auton.
- Continue Driver Practice.

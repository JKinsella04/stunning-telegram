# 1/25/22-1/27/22
```{Note}
Due to COVID our school went virtual last week causing us to skip practice on 1/18/22-1/20/22.
And the tournament on 1/22/22 was also rescheduled due to COVID for 2/12/22. So now our next tournament is 2/5/22.
```

## 1/25/22 
### Attendance: &#9745;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Continue AWP routine.
- Continue driver pratice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Continue AWP routine.
- &#9745; Continue driver pratice.
- &#9745; Reinforce drive base.

#### How:
- Today Derek reinforced the drive base by adding another cross bar to it. Due to the scoring mechanisms on our robot we only had one cross bar. While adding the second cross brace to the robot Derek also noticed that the spacing on our back lift was incorrect and was forcing the back of the drive base to expand and the front to contract. 

- Jack continued working on the AWP routine and now the robot can consistently score the AWP bonus but still needs tuned to score neutral mobile goals. Tomorrow he will begin working on the elim auton since that auton is also very important.

- Derek continued practicing driving today and will start doing skills runs tomorrow.
#### Why:
- Derek added another cross bar because it is important that our robot is strong enough to be able to get hit by other robots during matches and not break. Adding another cross bar will strengthen us against match defense as well as make the robot less malleable altogether.

- Jack will start on the Elim auton tomorrow because it is very important that we have an autonomous that grabs yellow goals quickly since most matches are determined by who has ownership of the neutral goals after the autonomous phase.


### Plans for next Practice:
- Start Elim auton.
- Continue Driver practice.

## 1/26/22 
### Attendance: &#9745;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Start Elim auton.
- Continue Driver practice.

### Accomplished:
- Finish Elim auton.
- Continue Driver practice.

#### How:
- Derek continued practicing driving and has changed the routine slightly. After elevating the first two goals Derek will grab the blue alliance goal and then grab the tall neutral goal. 
 
- Today Jack made the elim auton. It is the same route that our old robot used just finetuned to our new robot. Since our robot is faster than before Jack was able to save 2 seconds on the autonomous bringing the run time down to 4 seconds. This is very good as it will help ensure that we get both goals before the opposing team gets either.

#### Why:
- Derek does this because grabbing a goal with the front lift shifts our center of gravity and can cause us to tip. If we grab a goal with the back lift our center of gravity stays at the center of the drive base allowing us to move quickly without tipping.

- Jack finetuned our old autonomous routine because it is the quickest auton for grabbing two neutral goals. He was able to save time by tuning the auton to not overshoot the goals by having the drive base stop before the middle line. This makes the autonomous quicker since it is driving less distance and also will lower the chances of the opposing alliance being able to grab the goal.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Finish AWP routine.
- Continue Driver practice.

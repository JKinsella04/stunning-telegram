# 1/25/22-1/27/22
```{Note}
Due to COVID our school went virtual last week causing us to skip practice on 1/18/22-1/20/22.
And the tournament on 1/22/22 was also rescheduled due to COVID for 2/12/22. So now our next tournament is 2/5/22.
```

## 1/25/22 
### Attendance: &#9745;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Continue AWP routine.
- Continue driver pratice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Continue AWP routine.
- &#9745; Continue driver pratice.
- &#9745; Reinforce drive base.

#### How:
- Today Derek reinforced the drive base by adding another cross bar to it. Due to the scoring mechanisms on our robot we only had one cross bar. While adding the second cross brace to the robot Derek also noticed that the spacing on our back lift was incorrect and was forcing the back of the drive base to expand and the front to contract. 

- Jack continued working on the AWP routine and now the robot can consistently score the AWP bonus but still needs tuned to score neutral mobile goals. Tomorrow he will begin working on the elim auton since that auton is also very important.

- Derek continued practicing driving today and will start doing skills runs tomorrow.
#### Why:
- Derek added another cross bar because it is important that our robot is strong enough to be able to get hit by other robots during matches and not break. Adding another cross bar will strengthen us against match defense as well as make the robot less malleable altogether.

- Jack will start on the Elim auton tomorrow because it is very important that we have an autonomous that grabs yellow goals quickly since most matches are determined by who has ownership of the neutral goals after the autonomous phase.


### Plans for next Practice:
- Start Elim auton.
- Continue Driver practice.

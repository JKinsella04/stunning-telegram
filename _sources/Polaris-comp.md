## Our Results
- We placed fourth in the qualification rankings with a record of 4-1-0 with 9 WP and 24 AP. 
> This tournament we made minor changes to our AWP routine during the matches which proved to be ultimately more harmful than helpful causing us to not score the AWP bonus as much as we hoped.
- We alligned with 9623E in the elimination bracket, and made it to finals with them. 
- We got second place in skills.
- Overall this tournament did not go as well for us but we did learn about what changes we need to make to better prepare for states which is in three weeks.

Our schedule for this November.
```

With only a month before our next tournament, we are not going to start building our new robot but instead have Derek work on the new robot design and improve our skills scores. Since our autonomous did not work, Jack is going to restart the skills routine entirely. We also want to redesign our ring blockers to allow us to park on the platforms.

| November Schedule | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Monthly Total |
|------------------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Programming      | 3 hours | 3 hours   | 0 hours  | 24 hours      |
| Driver           | 1 hour  | 1 hour    | 4 hours  | 24 hours      |

With the practices split up like this Jack will have 24 hours to work on the skills auton and give Derek 24 hours to practice driving.

# August 31<sup>st</sup> & September 2021

## 8/31/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack

### Goals:
- Design Lift robot.
- Dissasemble and reorganize our parts.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Design Lift robot.
- &#9745; Dissasemble and reorganize.

#### How:
- Derek cadded the Lift robot using the application Blender and began building the drive base. Below are pictures of the CAD.
```{admonition} Parts Order
With the Lift design, there are many parts thats we have to order, so we will be slowed for a while but are on pace to have the drive base finished by this week. 
```
- A very important part of every new season is to reorganize our materials and tools from last season. While Derek was designing Brody and Jack disassembled our Change Up robot from last season.

#### Why:
- Following our September schedule, we will need to finalize the robot by the end of September so we have enough time to practice driving and create autonomous routines.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Continue building drive base.

## 9/1/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack

### Goals:
- Continue building the drive base.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Build half of the drive base.

#### How:
- Derek continued building the drive base based off the CAD designed yesterday.

#### Why:
- While converting the CAD into a physical robot Derek is taking extra time to make sure it is all correct. Since we have alloted this entire week for building the drive base we are making sure to maximize our time to ensure the utmost quality in the drive base since it is arguably the most important mechanism.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Complete drive base.

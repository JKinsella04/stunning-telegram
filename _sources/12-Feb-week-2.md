# 2/8/22-2/10/22
## 2/8/22 
### Attendance: &#9744;  Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Improve match autons.
- Continue Driver practice.

### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Continue Driver practice.
- &#9745; Improve Elim auton.

#### How:
- Today Derek continued driver practice and is more consistently getting the 310 skills run completed. Since he was unable to achieve it at the last tournament he is focusing even harder to ensure that this weekend he gets it.
- Jack improved the elim auton by using the rest of the 15 seconds to better manuever the neutral goals so driving is easier for Derek. Now the robot grabs the smaller neutral goal with the front lift instead of the back lift and the robot drops the tall neutral goal into the corner and then finishes by grabbing the alliance goal with the back lift.

#### Why:
- This improves the autonomous because it gives Derek a much easier starting position once the driver phase starts. Before he would have to drop both goals and grab the small neutral goal and the alliance goal. Now Derek can just start driving and scoring rings onto the goal since the robot will start with the goals he needs to hold.

### Plans for next Practice:
- Improve AWP auton. 
- Improve skills auton.
- Continue Driver practice.

# 10/5/21-10/7/21
## 10/5/21
### Attendance: &#9745; Brody, &#9745; Derek, &#9745; Jack
### Goals:
- Continue AWP autonomous
### Accomplished:
- &#9745; Finish AWP autonmous
#### How:
- Jack finished the AWP auton routine today. The autonomous takes a total of 9 seconds so we have six seconds to spare. With this extra time we might also work on grabbing one of the three yellow goals as well.
- This autonomous is really fast because Jack converted the movement from the first alliance goal to the second from 4 separate movments into 1 continuous movement. Jack believes that performing one action will be more accurate then doing 4 smaller movements because the more movements that happen the more error buildup is possible.

#### Why:
- We decided to just focus on the AWP autonomous today since Jack was able to make sure quick progress on the auton. With this routine finished for the rest of the month all we have to do is continue running it to make sure it is consistent.
### Plans for next Practice:
- Begin working on the Elimination match autonomous.

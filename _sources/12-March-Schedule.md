This weekend is the South Carolina state championship (March 5th) so with only a week to go we will be working on our skills auton as well as practicing driving. We are very excited to compete in our last South Carolina competition. First though we have our remote interview for the CREATE national event today (March 1st). The interview will happen after our practice tuesday and will be for judged awards for the tournament which is on March 28-30th.
